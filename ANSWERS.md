5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
A bit confusing at first, I spent most of the time on this homework
looking stuff up and looking at last weeks homework. The docs were pretty helpful though.
I liked this less than last weeks homework though as it was more open ended but it turned out to be fine.
I would like a little more hand holding, but its okay as it forces me to learn independently.
